## 2:03pm - Attempted to install thefuzz library
- Tried to install the thefuzz library for fuzzy matching
- Encountered issues with pip installation
- Will proceed with running the enhanced preprocessing script
- The script will use the fallback exact matching method for IRS data
- The improved owner name cleaning should still provide better results

## 2:02pm - Fixed owner name cleaning and improved IRS data matching
- Modified the clean_owner_name function to preserve entity type information (CORPORATION, INC, etc.)
- Removed the regex that was stripping business entity suffixes
- Now only standardizing case, spacing, and removing special characters
- Increased the threshold for detecting significant name changes from 50% to 80% similarity
- Implemented fuzzy matching for IRS data enrichment:
  - Added support for the thefuzz library with a fallback to exact matching
  - Set a 80% similarity threshold for fuzzy matches
  - Added detailed logging of match scores
  - Expanded the IRS data fields being captured
- These changes should:
  - Reduce the number of owner name standardization warnings
  - Improve the IRS data match rate (currently only 0.18%)
  - Better preserve the original data integrity
  - Follow the data.md guidelines more closely

## 2:01pm - Reviewing data cleaning issues
- Identified issue with owner name cleaning removing entity type information (CORPORATION, INC, etc.)
- This is causing unnecessary warnings and potential matching issues with IRS data
- Will modify the clean_owner_name function to preserve entity type information
- Reviewing other fields being cleaned to ensure they follow the data.md requirements
- Other fields being cleaned/standardized:
  - APNs: Removing non-alphanumeric characters
  - City names: Standardizing to uppercase, special handling for Oakland variations
  - Addresses: Combining components into a standardized format
  - Geocoding: Converting coordinates to numeric values and validating ranges

## 1:54pm - Analyzed validation report
- Reviewed the validation report generated by the enhanced preprocessing script
- Key findings:
  - No schema or data type issues detected
  - No null value issues in required fields
  - Value range issues:
    - 488,965 records with longitude below minimum valid value
    - 488,965 records with latitude above maximum valid value
    - These appear to be records with missing or invalid geocoding data
  - Standardization issues:
    - 717 owner name cleaning warnings (primarily suffix removals)
    - 38 APN standardization issues
  - Join success rates:
    - Address points join: 129.43% (multiple address points per parcel)
    - Final geocoding rate: 129.43%
    - IRS match rate: 0.18% (very low, opportunity for improvement)
- Recommendations for improvement:
  - Investigate the geocoding issues (invalid lat/long values)
  - Implement fuzzy matching for IRS data to improve match rate
  - Review owner name standardization approach to reduce warnings

## 1:53pm - Successfully executed enhanced preprocessing script
- The enhanced preprocessing script completed successfully after fixing the JSON serialization issue
- Generated all required output files:
  - pilot_candidates_main.csv (14,314 records)
  - pilot_owners_profile.csv (361 records)
  - pilot_properties_profile.csv (14,314 records)
  - pilot_candidates_main_oakland.csv (2,716 records)
  - pilot_owners_profile_oakland.csv (116 records)
- Generated a comprehensive validation report (preprocessing_validation_report.json)
- Validation summary: 0 errors, 760 warnings
- Warnings primarily related to owner name standardization (removing suffixes like "CORPORATION", "INC")
- The script identified 8,391 properties exceeding the individual threshold (1.22%)
- The script identified 14,273 properties with owners exceeding the threshold (2.08%)
- Total properties meeting any threshold: 14,273 (2.08%)
- IRS data enrichment matched 709 of 392,119 owners (0.18%)
- 7,685 of 685,216 properties (1.12%) were enriched with IRS data
- Geocoding coverage: 610,633 properties (129.43%) - note: this percentage exceeds 100% due to multiple address points per parcel
- Missing geocoding after fallback: 74,583 properties (15.81%)

## 1:52pm - Fixed JSON serialization error in enhanced preprocessing script
- Added a custom NumpyEncoder class to handle NumPy data types in JSON serialization
- Modified the save_validation_report function to use the custom encoder
- The encoder converts:
  - np.integer to Python int
  - np.floating to Python float
  - np.ndarray to Python list
  - np.bool_ to Python bool
- This will allow the validation report to be properly serialized to JSON

## 1:51pm - Encountered JSON serialization error in enhanced preprocessing script
- The script encountered an error when trying to save the validation report
- Error: "Object of type int64 is not JSON serializable"
- This is caused by NumPy's int64 type values in the validation statistics
- Need to convert NumPy data types to Python native types before JSON serialization
- Will implement a custom JSON encoder or conversion function to handle NumPy types

## 1:49pm - Testing enhanced preprocessing script
